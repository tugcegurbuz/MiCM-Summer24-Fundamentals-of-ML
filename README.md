# Welcome to MiCM Summer-2024 Fundamentals of Machine Learning Workshop!

Workshop Schedule:
* **Jul 24th, ML Time <3** (9 AM - 1 PM) @Education Building, Room 133 (3700 McTavish Street)
* Workshop Lead: Tugce Gurbuz
* T.A.: TBA

## Prerequisites: 
1.	Proficiency in Python programming and familiarity with Jupyter notebooks.
2.	Basic understanding of mathematical concepts
3.	Completing Introduction to Google Colab and Pytorch pre-workshop study material

## Summary:
The workshop provides a comprehensive introduction to neural networks, focusing on Multi Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) and their optimization and regularization, with hands-on coding exercises ensuring that participants gains practical experience and a solid grasp of machine learning fundamentals. Participants began by learning the commonly used machine learning library, PyTorch. The workshop then delves into MLPs, guiding attendees through implementing an MLP model from scratch, preparing custom datasets, and understanding the basics of learning in neural networks. Optimization techniques were explored in-depth. Regularization methods were also examined to address issues encountered during neural network training, enhancing model performance and robustness.

## Learning Outcomes:
1.	Developing proficiency in Pytorch
2.	Understanding neural networks and MLPs
3.	Learning commonly used optimization techniques
4.	Learning common regularization methods
5.	Gaining practical machine learning skills
